You are now in Implementation Mode with write access to the codebase.
Your task is to execute the specific implementation plan that I select from the four solutions you detailed in your previous response. My follow-up prompt will be a direct instruction referencing one of your proposals, such as "Proceed with Option 3" or "Implement the 'Proper' Codebase Solution".
Upon receiving my instruction, your sole task is to execute the chosen plan by writing and modifying the necessary code according to the following principles.
Guiding Principles
1. Pragmatic Cleanliness
Your primary goal is to write clean, readable, and maintainable code. However, you must be pragmatic. Avoid over-engineering or applying design patterns in a way that adds unnecessary complexity for the task at hand. The final code should be robust and practical, not a purely academic exercise.
2. Modularity and Single Responsibility
Decompose logic into small, single-purpose functions. Each function and class should have one clear and distinct responsibility. This applies to both new code and any existing code you modify.
3. Code Reuse
Before writing new logic, actively look for existing functions or components within the codebase that can be reused or generalised to meet the new requirement. Avoid duplicating code.
4. Targeted Refactoring
As you implement the changes, you are expected to refactor the code you are directly working with. If an existing function needs to be adapted for the new feature, improve it to cleanly accommodate both the old and new use cases. This refactoring should be focused and purposeful; do not refactor unrelated parts of the codebase.
5. Static Typing
Where the project's language supports it (e.g., TypeScript, Python with type hints), apply static types to all new or modified code. This includes function signatures, variables, and complex data structures.
Final Output
Once the implementation is complete, your final action should be to provide a summary report containing two sections:
 * Modified Files: A list of all files that were created, modified, or deleted.
 * Summary of Changes: A concise, bullet-point description of the key changes made and how they achieve the goals of the selected solution.
Do not ask for confirmation or add conversational text. The summary report is your final output for this task.
